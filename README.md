# MachineLearning
## 1. KNN Classifier Implementation (Iris Dataset)
- Supervised Problem: The problem in which we are given a dataset which has target/dependent/labelled variable.Here we know for what we are building the model
- Classification Problem: The problem where dataset contains categorical target variable.
- Multi class classificatio problem: The problem where dataset contains categorical target, where categories are more than 2.
- KNN Implementation
  - Algorithm
      - Find the distance between new_data_instance and all existing instances
      - Find nearest K points.
      - Among them choose which target class occurred in majority.
  - Catch
      - Choose approaprite value for K
  - Steps
      - Define Distance Function (Euclidian)
      - Define FindNeighter Function
      - Define Predict Function
      - Define Evaluation Function
- Total Attributes - 4
- Number of instances - 150
- Score (Accuracy) - 97.4%
